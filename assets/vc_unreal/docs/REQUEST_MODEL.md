This command requests the model to be loaded into the game. It is almost always required when using commands that spawns characters, vehicles, objects, or weapons. This is also used to speed up loading certain map objects that you want to load quickly. Command 0248 checks if the model has been loaded, command 038B loads all models without the need for 0248, and command 0249 marks the model as no longer needed.
