This command immediately loads all models requested using commands 0247, 0352, or others. The game temporarily freezes until all requested models have been loaded. When using this command, it is unnecessary to use command 0248 to check if the models have been loaded. Commands that make use of the models like 009A and 00A5 can do so immediately after this command without any chance of the game crashing due to unloaded models. Whether to use this command or 0248 is mainly a design choice &mdash; do you want to freeze the game until all models are loaded or allow the game to run while it loads the models at its own pace?
